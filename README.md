# DriverPass-Project

In this project I ws given the instructions to create a database desgin for a company named DriverPass.
The owner of DriverPass wanted to create a system that would help young driver pass their driving test.
This system would have the ability to allow customers to set up lessons where they would be able to choose 1 of 3 packages. Then they would be able pick a driver and car for the lessons.
This system will also allow the owner to view needed files and track vehicles that are out for lessons. Then the IT manager will be able to update and modify the system.
To help make sure that the resources and info on the DriverPass site is correct, the owner wished to connect to the DMV. Meaning that when the DMV updated, then theDriverPass system would update as well.

I feel that I did very well with the UML Class Diagram. I went into depth to give every class the proper functions and actions needed to make sure the system worked.

I feel that the Use Case Diagram that I made needs lots of work. I feel that I didn't fully develop the users and what they can do in the DriverPass system. If I were to go back and fix the diagram I would give a deeper thought to each diffrent user and show in the diagram the multitude of actions the users can do.

To keep the users needs in mind I made sure that the Owner and IT manager are able to get into the system and do the required actions of that user. The Owner asked to make sure that the system was able to be accessed on any computer or mobile he used so that he can view files and track vehicles that are out and about. On top of that the Owner wanted to make sure that they system could run on the cloud so that the main worry that they would have would be the need to update the system and modify it when needed.

When I first saw this project I wanted to approach it with the mindset of making sure that I met every requirment of the owner and then to make sure to add a few more quality of life modifications, such as make the passwords for accounts Case-sensitive to add a bit of needed security. By doing this I make sure that the owner of the system is happy, and to make sure that the system will be easier to maintain later down the road.
